<ul>
<li>SiteÂ properties can now be defined as a secret, which will ensure their value is stored and encrypted in the database. This requires LifeTime 11.20.1 or higher and Service Studio 11.54.35 or higher. You can learn more about the feature <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=dc811245-bcef-4579-bcee-3530a997eecd">here</a>. (R11BRT-737)</li>
<li>Added a site property on PreviewInDevices system component named ForceRequestURL to skip assigning the default DNS to the request URL. The default value is false. (R11DT-2095)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.25.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Platform Installer and Configuration Tool sometimes failing to execute correctly if they are launched from the latest versions of PowerShell 7. (R11BRT-651)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the frame-ancestors and report-uri to be included as meta elements in the index.html file. <br />
This occurred for Reactive and Mobile apps when <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/managing_the_applications_lifecycle/secure_the_applications/apply_content_security_policy/">CSP was enabled</a>, leading to errors in the browser console since those CSP directives were not valid when added as meta elements.<br />
Now, both directives have been removed from the index.html file. (R11DT-1957)</li>
<li>Email screens from reactive and mobile apps are now being considered <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/licensing/application_objects/">Application Objects</a>. The platform was not considering these objects in the total AO count, which was not expected. This may impact the AO usage limit. Traditional Emails were unaffected by this change as they were already being considered in the AO count.  (R11DT-2058)</li>
<li>Fixed a Base URL validation that did not allow the usage of http:// in Rest Consume. (RO11IT-614)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the immediate detection of custom device type and orientation.<br />
This occurred when using <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/reference/outsystems_apis/javascript_api/view/#registerdeviceclassgetter"> OutSystems API registerDeviceClassGetter</a>. Previously, this function was only being called upon orientation change or resize events.<br />
Now, the function is also called upon registration. This affects Reactive and Mobile apps. (RPM-1764) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Interface</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an aggregate to show no data when fetching data from a local entity with a filter. <br />
This occurred when a local entity was exposed in a producer module, reused in a consumer module and also renamed in the consumer module. Using an aggregate in the consumer module to fetch filtered data from the renamed local entity would return no results.<br />
Now, the aggregate shows the expected filtered data. This affects mobile apps only. (RPM-2149) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused `Invalid login for <runtime user>` when running the Configuration Tool with the `/UpgradeInstall` flag on an unattended installation with integrated logins for the database. (RPM-2204) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> </li>
<li>Fixed OnParametersChanged event being incorrectly triggered on WebBlocks. Before, WebBlocks with input parameters being Client Variables of type Long Integer/Decimal/DateTime would trigger the OnParametersChanged event even if their values remained the same. Now, the event is only triggered when the parameter values are modified. This applies to Reactive and Mobile apps. (RPM-2378) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented users from making a deployment via Lifetime, with the error message "error while checking reference status", due to an inconsistency triggered by the simultaneous publishing of a module. (RPM-3143) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed the Apply Settings operation locking modules for its entire duration.
Now, modules are unlocked as soon as each one is processed.
There is now also a General Log to help track the operation's progress, and another for its completion. (RPM-3719) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Disabled query parameters sorting when redirecting to an external URI with a query string. Before, the parameters were being sorted alphabetically, which could affect the correct parsing of screen inputs (when the URI is directed to an existing screen with inputs in a certain order). Now, the order introduced in the query string of the external URI is respected. This applies to Reactive/Mobile apps. (RPM-4018) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">SEO Friendly URLs</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Substr() function from working correctly when the input string contained Emojis or non-Latin characters.
The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading '2')" if using Chrome or Edge, or a "e.match(...) is null" if using Firefox was shown for reactive/mobile apps when executing the  Substr() function passing as parameters a text that contains Surrogate Pair characters or emojis and other non-Latin characters and the length argument is BIGGER than the length of the text. (RPM-423) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause Processes not to be re-queued after a failure, due to concurrency. (RPM-4264) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Processes</span> </li>
<li>Fixed Service Center operations like updating Site Properties and Timers when the configuration "Allow headers removal inside onBeforeRequest REST callback" is enabled in Factory Configuration. Before this correction, the pages would not give any feedback and the Site Properties and Timers values would not get updated. (RPM-4446) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Server.API</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a 404 error when opening a screen.<br />
This occurred for reactive apps that had a screen with a custom page name configured and site rule for the same module.<br /> (RPM-4462) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">SEO Friendly URLs</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused logs to still be generated even after disabling in Service Center **Activity Logging** for the module. This issue occurred only in OutSystems Cloud environments and for modules that were consuming the <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=F5F17E2A-F130-40EF-AD5E-7774D3295FE7">CentralizedPlatformLogs extension</a>. The fix repaired the behavior and now the logs are correctly disabled when **Activity Logging** is off. (RPM-4509) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logging</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a security vulnerability, CVSSv3.1 score 7.5 (High).
Updated Oracle Data Provider for .NET Managed driver to version 19.21.0. Dropped support to Oracle 11g as an external database.

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applications that make use of <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=dc811245-bcef-4579-bcee-3530a997eecd">secret site properties</a> and were staged to an environment with LifeTime version 11.20.0 or lower will have "Unable to decrypt content" runtime errors when accessing the secret site property value. The issue will be solved in LifeTime version 11.20.1. 
It's possible to mitigate the issue by going to Service Center and defining the proper Effective value for the secret site property. Please note this is a temporary measure and won't prevent the problem from resurfacing. It's therefore important to upgrade LifeTime to 11.20.1 (the minimal version that has support for secret site properties) or higher as soon as possible to prevent the issue from happening again.</li>
