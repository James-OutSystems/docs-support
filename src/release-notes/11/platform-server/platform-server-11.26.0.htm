<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.26.0" >New in Platform Server 11.26.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solution publishing performance improvements introduced in 11.23.1 are now available to all OutSystems customers upgrading to 11.26.0 (R11PT-582)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.26.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed troubleshooting traces of Configuration Tool to have better details of failed requests during ServiceCenter initialization, System Components publish and Upgrade Environment steps (R11BRT-799)</li>
<li>Fixed System Components installation in Configuration Tool where the process would fail with either “HTTP NotFound” or “An error occurred while sending the request” messages. This fix only covers installation architectures without dedicated Deployment Controller machines, the issues can still occur on those on situations. (R11BRT-821)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an Internal Error “Invalid compiler output. Parent not found for a iteration variable.“ when publishing a module where a “ForEach” node was used inside a System Client Action. (R11DT-2281)</li>
<li>Fixed a misbehavior that caused OnApplicationReady to be triggered twice when opening mobile applications with a Splash screen. (R11DT-2287)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented users with CSP settings enabled to use AppFeedback in their Reactive Applications. The issue occurred because a JavaScript used by AppFeedback was being obtained from an outside source, which was blocked when CSP settings are turned on. (RPM-1855) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">App Feedback Backoffice / ECT</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause browser tab titles not to update accurately when changing screens. The issue only occurred when a non-active screen was yet finishing an action while the application was on another screen. This applies to Reactive and Mobile apps. (RPM-2278) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was blocking the execution of timers of cloned modules through Service Center. This issue would not have any impact to the original modules from which the clones were made. (RPM-3101) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Added a missing pt-BR translation on ECT_Provider (App Feedback). Now, the message "Type your feedback here and click on the screen to point the location you want to highlight" is translated to "Escreva seu feedback e clique na tela para indicar o que pretende destacar". (RPM-3583) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">App Feedback Backoffice / ECT</span> </li>
<li>Improved the CleanupPersistentLogin timer of Service Center, by deleting old table records in batches, and a new index was added to the persistent_login table. (RPM-3830) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Removed X-WebKit-CSP and X-Content-Security-Policy headers from Reactive and Mobile apps, leaving only the Content-Security-Policy header. (RPM-4241) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Introduced an option to disable time zone shifts for Null Dates in Mobile/Reactive. Client-side date and time variables rely on the device time zone. If it changes from UTC to UTC-1, Null Dates shift from '1900-01-01 00:00:00' to '1899-12-31 23:00:00'. This option can be turned off on Factory Configuration to ensure a Null Date is always '1900-01-01 00:00:00'. (RPM-4484) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the error "System.MissingMethodException: Method Not Found" at login in detached applications that use SAML authentication. (RPM-4536) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Application Detach</span> </li>
</ul>
