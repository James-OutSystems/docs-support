# Protecting OutSystems Apps From Redirects / Forwarders Vulnerabilities

Attackers can trick users by taking advantage of unvalidated redirects or forwarders. In these cases victims trust your URL but are redirected to a malicious site.

When applications redirect users to other pages using dynamic URLs in its parameters, it allows attackers to provide a valid URL with a redirect parameter to a malicious site.

The following example from the [OWASP documentation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards) shows how an unvalidated redirect can be exploited to send a user to a malicious site.
